    team_deep_dive: "Max Rhodes spent 5 years at Square, most recently as Head of Product for Square Capital, where he saw firsthand how small businesses struggled with inventory purchasing and cash flow. This direct exposure to SMB pain points led him to co-found Faire in 2017 with three other Square alumni: Marcelo Cortes (CTO, ex-Square engineering lead), Jeff Kolovson (ex-Square Capital), and Daniele Perito (ex-Square ML team).\n\nThe founding team's Square DNA is evident in everything — from the elegant product design to the sophisticated ML recommendations to the embedded financial products (net-60 terms). Max combines product vision with strong operational discipline — he scaled Faire from 0 to $12.4B valuation in 5 years while maintaining relatively efficient growth.\n\nThe team has grown to 1,000+ employees across offices in SF, Toronto, São Paulo, London, and Amsterdam. Key executive hires include a COO from Shopify and a CFO from DoorDash. The engineering team (400+) is world-class, with deep ML/data science expertise driving the recommendation engine that powers 40%+ of retailer purchases.\n\nKey concern: The team is executing well internationally but the burn rate has increased. Need to see a clear path to profitability in the core North American market before aggressively funding international expansion.",
    due_diligence: {
      market_analysis: "The global wholesale market is $8.5 trillion, with online B2B marketplaces representing a rapidly growing segment at 15%+ CAGR. The independent retail segment specifically — Faire's core market — represents approximately $400B in annual wholesale purchasing in the US alone. Faire has captured less than 2% of this, leaving massive room for growth.\n\nThe market dynamics strongly favor marketplace aggregators: independent retailers want access to more brands, brands want efficient distribution to independent retailers, and both sides benefit from data-driven matching and financial products.",

        { name: "Amazon Business", positioning: "Massive scale but focused on commodity/office supplies, weak in curated indie brands", advantages: "Amazon's distribution, Prime-like benefits, massive catalog", weaknesses: "Not curated for indie retail, commoditized products, doesn't understand boutique retail" },
        { name: "Handshake (Shopify)", positioning: "Shopify's B2B marketplace — leverages Shopify merchant base", advantages: "Shopify ecosystem integration, growing merchant base", weaknesses: "Limited to Shopify brands, less sophisticated ML matching, no financial products" },

      ],
      technology_assessment: "Faire's ML recommendation engine is a genuine technical moat. The system analyzes purchasing patterns across 700K+ retailers to predict which products will sell well in specific stores based on location, store type, previous purchases, and seasonal trends. Retailers report that Faire-recommended products have 30% higher sell-through rates than self-selected products.\n\nThe net-60 payment terms and free returns are powered by sophisticated risk models that assess brand reliability and product quality. Default rates are remarkably low (<2%) despite extending significant credit to small brands.",
      regulatory_landscape: "Faire's financial products (net-60 terms, effectively trade credit) operate in a relatively light regulatory environment. However, as they expand lending products, state-by-state lending regulations and potential federal oversight of fintech lending could apply. International expansion requires compliance with local trade and payment regulations in each market.",
      go_to_market_strategy: "Faire uses a dual-sided marketplace growth strategy. Brand acquisition is driven by a sales team and inbound from indie brand communities. Retailer acquisition is increasingly organic (word-of-mouth + Faire markets/events). The marketplace flywheel is powerful: more brands attract more retailers, which attract more brands.\n\nInternational expansion is a key growth lever — launched in UK, France, Germany, Netherlands, Australia, and Brazil. Each market requires local brand sourcing and retailer community building.",
      financial_projections_review: "Faire reached $1B+ in gross merchandise volume (GMV) and is growing 30%+ year-over-year. Revenue is generated through commission on transactions (typically 15-25% from brands) plus financial product margins. The company is not yet profitable but has a clear path — North American unit economics are strong and approaching contribution margin positivity.\n\nThe Series G raised at $12.4B was in late 2022; subsequent markdowns have brought the estimated fair value to $6-8B range. Our follow-on allocation at the current valuation represents an attractive entry point relative to the peak.",
      investment_thesis: "Faire is building the operating system for independent retail wholesale. The combination of ML-powered product matching, financial products (net-60 terms, free returns), and growing international presence creates a powerful and defensible marketplace. Our early seed investment has generated exceptional returns, and this follow-on opportunity allows us to increase our position at a more reasonable valuation post-correction.\n\nThe key question is timing to profitability. If Faire can achieve profitability in North America while maintaining 30%+ international growth, the path to a $20B+ outcome is clear.",
